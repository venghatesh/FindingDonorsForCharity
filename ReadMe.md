# Content: Supervised Learning
## Project: Finding Donors for CharityML

## Project Overview
In this project, we will apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. we will first explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, we will apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. we will then evaluate several supervised learners of your choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, we will optimize the model you've selected and present it as your solution to CharityML. Finally, we will explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.

## Project Highlights
This project uses many supervised learning algorithms available in sklearn, and also provides methods of evaluating just how each model works and performs on a certain type of data. It is important in machine learning to understand exactly when and where a certain algorithm should be used, and when one should be avoided.

## Goal 
- Identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
- Establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
- What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
- Investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.

## Software Requirements

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python 3.0](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)


## Starting the Project


This project contains three files:

- `finding_donors.ipynb`: This is the main file which contains the python code. 
- `census.csv`: The project dataset. 
- `visuals.py`: A Python file containing visualization code
