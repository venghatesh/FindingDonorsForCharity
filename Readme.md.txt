Project Overview

In this project, Supervised learning techniques is applied on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause.
CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. 

With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML has brought us on board to help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. 

our goal will be to 
Evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.
Explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded. 
Apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. 
Evaluate several supervised learners of our choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. 
Optimize the model we've selected and present it as your solution to CharityML. 
Explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.
